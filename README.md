# Event Exporter
A simple World of Warcraft Add-on that generates an export string from calendar invites of a selected event. The string is then input into another project of mine (Discord chat bot Patrisha) where it parses the string and generates a spreadsheet with the information (Who accepted, who declined, who's tentative, etc.).

If you want to include Patrisha in your own server, you can do so with the following link - https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=409087146281140234&scope=bot
